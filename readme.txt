This is a fork of QuickJS to accomplish a few platform ports.   QuickJS is an amazing and tiny implementation of EcmaScript 2020 by Fabrice Bellard and Charlie Gordon under an MIT license.

This fork supports porting to ZOS and Windows.  The windows port does not use Cygwin or MinGW, because Windows has come closer in recent years to supporting most Posix API's.   

The main documentation is in doc/quickjs.pdf or doc/quickjs.html.
